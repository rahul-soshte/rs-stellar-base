A library that offers a comprehensive set of functions for reading, writing, hashing, and signing primitive XDR constructs utilized in the Stellar network. it provides a nice abstraction for building and signing transactions

**This project is currently alpha-ish and is compatible with Protocol 22 and you can use it for  buidling and signing transactions that involve interacting with Soroban. It is a work in progress and is subject to significant changes, including the addition or removal of features and modifications to its functionality.**

## Quickstart

Add this to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
stellar-baselib = "0.5.0"
```

And this to your code:

```rust
use stellar_baselib::*;
```

## How to run tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Coding Best Practices Used

1. All Rust code is linted with Clippy with the command `cargo clippy`. If preferred to ignore its advice, do so explicitly:
   `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`

2. All rust code is formatted with `cargo fmt`. rustfmt.toml defines the expected format.

3. Function and local variable names follow snake_case. Structs or Enums follow CamelCase and Constants have all capital letters.
